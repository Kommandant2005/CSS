<h1>This is my second CSS project.</h1>
<p>
It was a very peaceful and lazy year in my perspective. 
I enjoyed sitting on the bed and working on my laptop.
I also enjoyed having small snacks during every period.
I am enjoying my coding classes a lot. I also like my ma'am a lot.
She teaches in a very interactive method by giving me many vivid real life examples.
She is also a very friendly teacher.
